# Hand-Education-Web-App
Education is a life-long process of growth and development. Education is considered 
a vital element in the development of a society, a system, and a country. Students in rural areas 
are not able to access education for a purpose. Due to which students are lagging behind in 
society and not able to compete with the outside world. In order to overcome this, Hand 
Education is been created to create awareness and bring happiness in a child’s life, through the 
medium of education, technology and fun events. 

To provide quality education and increase awareness among people this website, 
Hand Education, will make people visit this website and understand the importance of 
education in a child’s life, especially children living in rural areas and who fall under crisis and 
end up doing child labor, child abuse, poverty, child marriage etc. The objective will be to 
make the user contribute as a donor or a sponsor or as a volunteer volunteering to our 
community, which can bring some change in a child’s life and make his future better and also 
make more options open in front of us in the world of communication.
